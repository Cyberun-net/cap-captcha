## What is Cap?

Cap is the modern, open-source alternative to traditional CAPTCHAs that uses proof-of-work instead of annoying visual puzzles.

It's built with JavaScript and Rust and has no dependencies. You can either run it on any JavaScript runtime (Bun, Node.js, Deno), or use the standalone mode with Docker.

Cap is built into 2 main parts. The [widget](https://capjs.js.org/guide/widget.html) is a small client-side JavaScript library using custom components and WASM that renders the CAPTCHA and solves the challenge.

The [Standalone Server](https://capjs.js.org/guide/standalone.html) is a Docker image that helps you use Cap with any language or framework. As an alternative, if your server-side uses JavaScript, you can use the lighter [server](https://capjs.js.org/guide/server.html) library.

Cap also has a [M2M library](https://capjs.js.org/guide/solver.html) that implements a custom proof-of-work solver for protecting API endpoints that you still want public.

   Cap doesn't send any telemetry back to our servers
- **Fully customizable**  
   Change the colors, size, position, icons and more with CSS variables
- **Proof-of-work**  
   Your users no longer have to waste time solving visual puzzles.

It's ideal for protecting APIs from bots, preventing spam on forms, blocking automated signup attempts and securing free-tier abuse.

Cap is a great alternative to [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/), [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) and [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).
